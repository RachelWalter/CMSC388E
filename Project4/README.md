"For your Final Project for this class, we want you to use principles of iterative design to improve your previous Interactive Media project. We want you to deliberately iterate on your previous user interactions.
For example,if you focused on audio inputs last time, how might you enhance that experience? Maybe think of different palettes of sound and how they fit together like ambient versus harsh noise."

My improvement on user interaction is using hardware as opposed to software to track movement.
