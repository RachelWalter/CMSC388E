"You guys are on your ways to becoming Processing masters! But before you can claim that sought after title, you must complete your third project : interactive media. In this project, you will have to integrate user interaction into your art piece. Be it through typing, moving, or more, the audience should have to interact with your piece in order to gain a more meaningful experience!"

For my first iteration of this project I am attempting to use video input data to track movement and create a new abstract art piece from movement/dance.
