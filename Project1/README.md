"The two goals for the first project will be to dip your feet in Processing and
experiment with the different things you can do in it and also explore basic
ideas of composition. We want you to become familiar with the processing
environment, but also create a piece that is well composed rather than just a
picture of randomly placed objects on the screen. Use ideas learned in class,
but feel free to explore and be creative with this project!"

For this first project, I wanted to experiment with using shapes, randomness, and repetition. 
For more information on my artistic process see the .pdf of my writeup.
