"This class aims to bring the creativity back into computing by teaching basic art and design principles through the medium of coding. By bringing together Processing, a visual arts coding language, and different hallmarks of art theory, we want to teach an innovative class that empowers students to connect with their creative side. Students should come in wih basic coding knowledge but can expect to leave with a greater appreciation for digital media."
